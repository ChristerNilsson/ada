"""
'simple' means this is for a simpler machine, which means this code is more complex than ada.py
ada.py has ada's original operations which are simpler than this

Ada assumed having math operations + - * /
Ada also assumed having data structures for non-integers. (Bernoulli numbers are rational numbers.)
I was doing research about a simple machine that has only operations + and - and only for integers.
So I was thinking about what it would take to run Ada's program on this simpler machine.

First, multiplication can be implemented with a software subroutine using addition.
Next, rational numbers can be represented with 2 integers, so we can translate the operations
on rational numbers to a sequence of operations on integers.
I add "n" to variable names for numerators and "d" for denominators.
I add "i" to variable names if the integer data structure suffices for that variable.
Lastly, given these previous solutions, the problem of division has disappeared.
(Dividing by 2/3 is just multiplying by 3/2.)

Reducing fractions is required in order to not quickly get into ridiculous
processing times and ridiculous bit lengths per integer.

Without reducing fractions:
Calculating B8 (the 4th non-trivial Bernoulli number) requires integers >32 bits
and ~20 seconds of processing time on a core i7.
Calculating B10 (the 5th non-trivial Bernoulli number) requires integers >64 bits
and I don't know how much processing time. I stopped it at 7 hours.

The machine I was thinking of is 8 bits, so I would like to see how far I can get with that.
Obviously B12 (-691 / 2730) has both a numerator and denominator that don't fit in 8 bits.
So I guess B10 is the goal.

Reducing fractions brings back the problem of division that had disappeared.
But that's not hard to implement in software, just like multiplication.
We can get to B6 by simply reducing some of the fractions after calculating them.
But that's not enough for B8 and B10. We'll need another subroutine for adding 2 fractions.
The most common (and most efficient) method for finding the lowest common denominator
involves multiplying the denominators, but that completely defeats the purpose
if we need to stay in 8 bits.
